# You2Musik

Youtube Downloader and music converter. The idea of this project is creates a Music Player of Youtube videos,
as frontend I used Angular (latest version from today) 

## Why you should download and use You2Musik?

At least me, I always play the same playlist everyday, to work, to play chess, etc and this was trouble selecting and opening the Youtube tab broser, then choosing the song's or playlist, bla bla. 
So, I had the idea to create this app to simplify this daily process.

```

```
